The captured CO2 will be calculated and transformed into carbon credits for companies to offset their carbon footprint. Our solution is space-saving, cost-effective, and more sustainable, and is the key to neutralizing CO2 emissions by 2050.","1.	Carbon offset credits
A considerable amount of CO2 in the atmosphere will be captured by our PBRs and locked in the biomass. Our system will monitor, calculate and record the quantity of CO2 absorbed by our PBRs, while SGS will qualify the entire system. The amount of CO2 absorbed will be converted to carbon credits which can be sold to different industries in Hong Kong.
2.	Algae products
The massive algae produced from our PBRs will be further processed into numerous industrial raw materials and high-end products, including but not limited to fish meals, food oil, food ingredients, cosmetics, and nutrition supplements.

On 14 May 2020, several Chinese regulatory bodies, including the People’s Bank of China (PBOC), China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (CBIRC), China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), and State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE), introduced a Circular. This Circular unveiled measures to foster an integrated financial services market within the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Greater Bay Area (GBA). A key initiative, the Wealth Management Connect (WMC), is a bilateral scheme that permits residents of mainland cities in the GBA to invest in wealth management products offered by banks in Hong Kong and Macau. Conversely, residents of Hong Kong and Macau can invest in wealth management products provided by mainland banks in the GBA. This initiative exemplifies the operational synergy of the GBA cluster. It grants GBA residents the liberty to purchase financial products across the nine cities in the GBA, including the two special administrative regions, Hong Kong and Macau. This newfound freedom to diversify into cross-border investments is anticipated to be highly sought after by Guangdong's affluent middle class. It also reinforces Hong Kong's stature as a Financial Hub. While traditional banks are expected to be the primary beneficiaries initially, small to medium-sized fund houses will also partake in this expanding opportunity. These private fund houses are the primary business partners and targets of FundTech (HK) Limited.

**Insights and Questions:**
1. **GBA Integration:** How will the integration of financial services in the GBA impact the broader financial landscape in Asia?
2. **Role of Hong Kong:** With the introduction of the Wealth Management Connect, how will Hong Kong's position as a financial hub evolve?
3. **Opportunities for Fund Houses:** As the financial market in the GBA expands, what unique opportunities and challenges will small and medium fund houses face?

",Mr. DI Zhang,"DIRECT DRIVE TECHNOLOGY LIMITED or DDT, was founded in April, 2018, with the mission of exploiting all kind of application with direct drive technology which is a promising replacement of all kind of speed reducer.","The application of robot joint has been widely used for more than decades. There are 4 core components in industrial robot joint: reducer, motor, driver and controller. The reducer in a six-axis-robot arm occupies approximately 20~30% of the whole cost. However, more than 50% of the wasted robot are caused by the high wear rate of reducer. Thus, the reducer is a critical and expensive component in traditional robot joint.
Our project aims to develop a new type of robot joint, which integrates with mature industrial technic and stable rare-earth magnet supply chain to achieve neo robot joint. The new robot joint can realize similar functionality without embedding complicated reducer.
The company name “Direct Drive” also implies the reduction of reducer and use motor as direct driving force.

",Miss. WAI SUM Li,"Founded in December 2018, BP InnoMed Limited is a spin-off company from the Hong Kong Baptist University, which has a vision to improve life of cancer patients by making innovative high-quality medicine and healthcare product safe and effective. 

The company was established with an exceptionally strong in-house scientific team and world-renown external consultants with chemical biology, medicinal chemistry and synthetic organic chemistry background. We are dedicated to developing a wide range of pioneering medical products, including theranostics probes, intelligent molecular sensors, and certain pro-drugs with diverse set of properties for medical diagnostics and cancer therapy or rehabilitation. 

Our current project focuses on the development and the commercialization of the “Theranostics inhibitors for eradicating Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) associated cancer”, for example, nasopharynx cancer (NPC), a common cancer especially in the southern part of China cancer.","Our current project focuses on developing and commercializing the “Theranostics inhibitors for eradicating Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) associated cancer”, including Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma, a cancer intimately related with EBV. To our knowledge, there is currently no FDA (or equivalent)-approved EBV-specific targeted therapy in the pharmaceutical industry.

BP InnoMed Limited had successfully established a probe – L2P4 – targeting EBNA1 (the only viral protein expressed in all EBV-associated cancer cells). Our probe can specifically inhibit EBV-associated tumour growth and in addition emit fluorescent signal when bound to EBNA1. The studies on our discovery show that 0.2 mg/kg of L2P4 is able to inhibit over 90% EBV-tumour growth in mice. We have also modified L2P4 by incorporating a zinc chelator to make a new EBNA1 inhibitor ZRL5P4, which can reactivate the EBV lytic induction.

Leading by our experienced professional team and under the protection of our intellectual properties, we aim to develop such EBV inhibitor to obtain IND approval and go through clinical trial 1.",BP InnoMed Limited,"Lab Bench M16, Units 101-103, 1/F, 15W & RM619, 6/F, Building 17W

Future historians will refer to the 2020s as an age of digital transformation when many aspects of the world’s socioeconomic activities transition online, accelerated by the pandemic, creating an impetus to solve the problem of digital identity, a problem as old as the internet itself. As a project connecting computers between trusted institutions, the Internet was not designed with digital identity and has now become a multi-billion-dollar problem ever since the Internet became available for civilian use. Emerging FDI leverages advanced cryptography (such as zero-knowledge proof) and trust technology (such as blockchains) to enable universally dependable digital identity.
","AKP offers solutions that are compatible with the decentralised identifier (“DID”) and verifiable credentials (“VC”) emerging standards of the World Wide Web Consortium (“W3C”) and the Pan-Canadian Trust Framework (“PCTF”) atomic processes, which are the de facto standard for digital identity worldwide.
AKP offers products (custom-built) or service (SaaS), depending on how the solution is to be delivered. 
Over the course of the HKSTP incubation programme, AKP plans to systematically productise the tools and components from its solutions to achieve economies of scale and higher consistency in solution delivery.
Furthermore, AKP is developing an open-sourced version of the aforementioned tools and components, so that AKP could be more scalable as a commercial venture, by delivering a higher proportion of SaaS solutions and increasing overall adoption of AKP tools and components.

At PhoMedics, we strive to unleash the full potential of the healthcare system. We are now developing a cutting-edge imaging technology, coined as CHAMP, that provides medical surgeons with instant and accurate information for the complete removal of cancer cells from patient's bodies during surgery, eliminating the need for repeated cancer surgeries.","PhoMedics developed a patented CHAMP Microscope ― a fast, accurate, and simple device for intraoperative cancer margin analysis. Free from any time-consuming preparation of tissue samples (e.g., slicing or chemical staining), CHAMP can simplify the clinical workflow down to minutes and preserve tissue integrity for a more accurate diagnosis. CHAMP not only helps to reduce the chance of second cancer surgery, but it also enables efficient allocation of hospital resources and benefits patients in the society. A virtual staining software is also developed to transform CHAMP images to the style that professionals can understand without additional training. This method comes with a high level of accuracy (>95%) that could be trusted by a medical professional. Successful results have been shown using brain and kidney tissues from mice with high structural similarity. With a promising lab-based clinical trial, an on-site clinical trial will start in Q2 2021.",PhoMedics Limited,"Room 633, 6/F, Building 17W,

",Dr. Chung Lim (Colin) Luk,"IsoFoodtrace authenticates food origin and production practices using a biochemical fingerprinting technique powered by stable isotope technology, offering time- and cost-efficient third-party test that assures customers of the identity of the products they buy.
Stable isotope analysis measures the natural weight variations in atoms of all biological materials, and acts as an identifying fingerprint. The technology eliminates supply chain auditing by directly testing only a few gram physical samples of the end product itself. Through machine learning analysis, these fingerprints can be harnessed to identify and confirm different attributes of food, including origin, wild-caught, organic, grass-fed and free-range.
","IsoFoodtrace uses machine learning to analyse stable isotopic ratios in food as a biochemical fingerprinting technique to authenticate claims of food origin and production practices. The range of food attributes that are currently testable include origin, wild-caught, organic, grass-fed and free-range.
Chemical elements such as carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen and sulphur have different naturally occurring forms that vary by weight. These forms are called stable isotopes, which constitute the core of our technology. . In crops and livestock, the heavy-to-light isotope ratios of chemical elements vary with geography and courses of nutrients . For example, organic vegetables contain more ‘heavy nitrogen’ than conventionally farmed vegetables because manure has more ‘heavy nitrogen’ than synthetic fertilizers. Utilising this biochemical phenomenon, we can scientifically trace, hence verify the food production attributes from the end product without the need of tedious auditing.
Analysis of stable isotopic ratios requires only a few grams of food sample, which is first purified and ground into a uniform powder, then reduced into gases using an Elemental Analyser. The resulting gases are subsequently fed into an Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometer, which sorts and measures the gases by weight to obtain the isotopic ratio. The detected isotope values of samples are then compared with a database of known sample values to confirm or refute labelled claims.

Our vision is to move from identification and annotation of organisms, genes and metabolites to design whereby we can draw on these relationships to construct immunoregulatory drugs with specified function through synthetic gene expression composed from known biosynthetic units.","VastBiome's Discovery Engine is a computational platform that identifies key genetic clusters of bacterial DNA, an in-vitro assessment of immunoregulatory function, and structural characterization of their molecular products.

Specific Innovations of our proposed approach include:

1. Computational identification of gene clusters at scale with an integrated learning capability for continuously improving gene cluster selection.

2. High-throughput probe-based interrogation of gene clusters for immunoregulatory potential providing annotations for improvement of the gene cluster selection algorithm as well as candidate gene clusters for further development as therapeutic leads.

3. Structural characterization and recombinant engineering resulting in the identification of potential therapeutic natural product compounds as well as the provision of a synthetic host capable of producing them.

4. Substantiation of this approach with the largest and most detailed multi-omic data set created for the assessment of the microbiome-host immune axis in the setting of ICI therapy.",VastBiome Limited,"Lab Bench 1a-d, Unit 708-716, 7/F & Room 615, 6/F, Building 17W

Primary Category: Fintech

Subcategory: Payment Solutions

Explanation: The company provides a platform for loyalty points, coupons and payments between consumers and merchants. Their focus seems to be on facilitating financial transactions and payments. Therefore, Fintech - Payment Solutions fits them best as the primary classification.

Secondary Category: ICT (Information and Communication Technology) 

Subcategory: Mobile Internet

Explanation: Since they offer a consumer mobile app, ICT - Mobile Internet could be a relevant secondary categorization. However, developing fintech payment solutions rather than general mobile apps appears to be their core focus.

Tertiary Category: ICT (Information and Communication Technology)

Subcategory: Big Data & Data Analysis

Explanation: As they connect a large network of consumers and merchants, analyzing engagement data may be applicable as a tertiary ICT classification. But this does not seem to be the central focus of the company.",,,"Unit 520A, 5/F, InnoCentre

We extend the pawnshop’s heritage by mobilizing quick finance & digital technology using A.I. and blockchain technology. We aim to stimulate alternative method for quick finance with collateral and promote the century-old pawning concept. We hope to educate and encourage youngsters to exchange their assets for short-term liquidity instead of future money.

Our vision is to make every luxury asset liquidable & investable and our mission is to digitalize the pawnshop funding process, help discover undervalued assets and increase the pawnshops’ liquidity.","1.AI Pawn Estimator™ - to Access the Latest Market Prices

Pawnbrokers estimate the assets by experience without referencing the latest secondary market prices or future price trend. By using our AutoML Vision and machine learning model, UNLE2 quickly recognise the object with brands, optimised loan-to-value(LTV) ratio and price references from different sources. Users could quickly get preliminary loan amount as a result.

2. QR Pre Ticket - to Keep Track and safeguard the pawning process

Once pawn request is matched, a new QR Code is auto-generated to show both identities and order details including loan principal, tenor and its relative accrued interest. Customers can check the status of the pawn goods anytime anywhere, especially the redemption deadline.

3. Asset Tokenization

UNCLE2 utilizes asset tokenization to convert pawn assets into digital assets on blockchain which enables fractional ownership of assets.

",Mr. Joseph TSANG,"IntuVision is a construction innovation startup dedicated to improving communication efficiency between construction parties. In construction projects, office and site teams are often separated by great physical distances, making it challenging for one to communicate or provide continuous in-person guidance to the other – an issue that has already incurred over billions USD per year in remedial costs. 

We understand that our industry has a desperate need for truly user-friendly, practical and safe innovations that leverage the power of recent advancements in Building Information Modelling (BIM) and AI for intuitive remote communication. Our flagship product, VisionBuilder, is a seamless and BIM-centric remote communication platform between sites and offices anytime and anywhere. This empowers contractors, consultants and project owners with the ability to effectively collaborate with each other even remotely and thereby increase construction productivity. 
","To pioneer the first seamless remote collaboration platform for construction, we provide three unique offerings: 

CollaboVision for allowing office and site teams to collaborate in real-time using video chat and live annotations; 

SuperVision for automatically projecting BIMs onto site structures without needing to scan QR codes or perform manual adjustments; 

ReVision for automatically saving design changes to a live BIM database to ensure an agile construction process. 

These are the three distinct solutions integrated into the VisionBuilder mobile and web platform.

",William Ho,"IoT, AI and mobile networks (e.g. 5G, 4G, LTE) are the key technologies that will change our life in the future. We leverage these technologies to build an open platform for our subscribers to manage their devices anytime and anywhere.

Our NB-IoT module supports universal connector and standard communication protocols. Our clients only need to integrate our NB-IoT module and subscribe to the service to control/monitor their devices through our AIoT portal.

We provide an end-to-end solution that is flexible to customise the workflow and automation processes, based on specific business requests, so our clients can address their operation issues by using our NB modules, platform and data.
","Our solution is developed by using NB-IoT module, Cloud platform and AI technology. 

Our client's device can easily enable IoT services if the device is integrated with our self-developed NB-IoT module built-in with a customised MCU. Moreover, OTA feature is enabled in the module so NB's MCU and the device's MCU can be updated via OTA. 

The Cloud platform is developed with the latest IoT technologies on the zero trust security model. Our client can use the features on the platform to remotely control or monitor their devices in anytime and anywhere. This objective is to increase device management efficiency for reducing the frequency of onsite support/maintenance. 

We leverage AI technology to optimise clients’ operation with the data collected from IoT devices. Moreover, we use ML technology to strengthen IoT devices as smarter devices to process data locally.

In the future, we will do research to modify the module via other wireless technologies (e.g. 5G network) and enhance the platform to provide more advanced AIoT-related features.

",Dr. Thomas Leon,"Our mission is to revolutionise drug and therapeutic discovery & development, and provide a novel and affordable solution for medical treatment, patient stratification and disease diagnostics for rare diseases of newborns.
We observed that there is a lack of effective treatment for rare diseases of newborns and there is an urgent need of human organ proxies in the dish for disease modelling, and biomarker, drug and therapeutic discovery. 
To fill the gap, we will provide state-of-the-art and first-in-class human disease organoids for personalised precision medicine, regenerative medicine and preventive medicine for rare diseases of newborns. Our organoid platform marks the beginning of the deployment of a novel and affordable solution for medical treatment, patient stratification and disease diagnostics. Our platform will have a significant impact in reducing mortality rate, saving billions of dollars in healthcare costs and improving the quality of life of individuals.
","Our human IPSC-derived organoids is an immediate solution to the problem.

An organoid is a miniaturised and simplified version of an organ produced in vitro in 3-dimensions that shows realistic micro-anatomy, resembling a near-to-native mini-organ in the dish. They are derived from tissue stem cells, embryonic stem cells or induced pluripotent stem cells (IPSCs), which can self-organise in 3-dimensional culture owing to their self-renewal and differentiation capacities. Organoids are used by scientists to study diseases and treatments in a laboratory.

GLOAS provides state-of-the-art technology platforms including patients’/normal human induced pluripotent stem cells (hIPSCs); first-generation patient’s/normal hIPSC-derived human organoids with one cell type (human organoids 1.0); second-generation advanced patient’s/normal human organoids with multiple cell types (human organoids 2.0); tissue hydrogel; and fabricated human bile duct to revolutionise the discovery and development of drugs and therapeutics for neonatal rare diseases.

","Scolicast revolutionises the brace casting by changing the process from “cast first and correct later” to “correct rest then cast”. This will eliminate the pitfall of relying on orthotists’ subjective experience and estimation to modify scoliosis braces after casting. Using data to support correction also helps to reduce the time it takes for casting.
Scolicast is composed of hardware and software to provide a cutting-edge scoliosis brace casting method.

Scolicast hardware can provide objective corrective force during casting using data, thus ruling out human subjective variance.
With the help of Scolicast software, we can modify (if needed) the contour of the patients’ trunk to shape the brace. We could also take global orders with the help of the software.

Flexible electronic devices are now increasingly commonplace in this new era of wearable and IoT technology. We have created revolutionary flexible, fast-charging textile-based lithium batteries that fit in perfectly with the growing market.","Flexible and wearable electronics – from smartwatches to flexible displays, health monitoring garments, and even robotics – are increasingly commonplace in our daily life. However, existing lithium-ion batteries for powering these products are rigid and bulky, causing discomfort to users. 
Under the supervision of Prof. Zheng Zijian in the Institute of Textiles and Clothing at PolyU, we have created revolutionary flexible lithium batteries to solve the problem. 
To replace the metallic foil used in conventional batteries, we have fabricated metallic fabrics by coating textiles with a thin layer of metal with our patented technology. As the textile is light, flexible and durable, and has large specific surface areas, our batteries show excellent mechanical flexibility and high energy density. At present, our textile-based batteries could achieve a high energy density (>450 Wh/L), remarkable flexibility (100% capacity @1000 folding cycles, bending radius ~1mm), and excellent cyclic stability (>80% capacity @500 charge/discharge cycles). 
When compared to conventional batteries, our textile-based batteries are really stable under deformation and have proved to be penetration- and impact-safe. Based on our technology, we won four prizes at the 43rd and 47th International Exhibition of Inventions of Geneva as well as the PolyU Microfund 2021.

為解決傳統電池的缺憾，理大紡織及服裝學系鄭子劍教授的研究團隊開發了新型的柔軟織物鋰電池。
為撇除一般電池所採用的金屬箔，研究團隊首先利用專利的聚合物輔助金屬沈積法，將高導電金屬均勻地沈積於經織物上，製成導電織物，用作電池中的集流體。由於導電織物具有低薄層電阻 和大比表面積。該電池擁有高能量密度（>450瓦時/升）和極佳的柔軟度：在折疊1,000次後 (彎折半徑少於1毫米)，效能仍然保持不變。電池亦具有良好循環穩定性，在充放電500次後，其循環後電池容量仍達80%以上。
同時電池已通過穿刺、剪切與耐擠壓試驗，擁有良好的可靠性和安全性。而憑著研發成果，團隊更於日內瓦第四十三和四十七屆國際發明展奪得金獎、銀獎和兩別優異獎，以及成功獲得2021年的理大微型基金。

Combined with advanced micro-fabrication, efficient filtering algorithm and signal amplification, and big data-driven training strategy, our product can achieve accurate EMG monitoring and analysis to assess personal health conditions. Smart EMG clothing is our key product, which is equipped with high performance micro-structured electrodes, a highly integrated processing unit, a movable signal acquisition system and a self-developed APP. With real-time monitoring of muscle activity, our product will help people train correctly and effectively. In the long term, we will integrate our product with more functions, like online coaching, injury alarm and consulting service. At the same time, we will expand our market, providing diverse products for sedentary behaviour detection and tools for the meta-universe and elderly health.","Our products are designed to assist athletes to reach their desired fitness level or maximum potential, whether they are novices, amateurs or professionals. With real-time monitoring of muscle activity, our product can help people train correctly and effectively. In the long term, we will integrate our product with more functions, like online coaching, injury alarm and consulting service. At the same time, we will expand our market, providing diverse products for sedentary behaviour detection, tools for the meta-universe and elderly health. For sedentary users like office workers, we will develop a vest-like product mainly focusing on the spine-related muscle groups near the neck, shoulders and lumbar area to help the user avoid lumbar muscle strain and other related physical conditions. For the elderly, we will launch a split mode product focusing on the lower limb muscle group. Simplified instructions and extra fall detection functions will be provided to prevent possible injuries in daily activities. By motion detection, our products will serve as tools for the connection between virtual and physical spaces, which facilitate the construction of meta-universe in the future.

Our company aims to tackle the limitations of current EMG sensors by developing two key technology i.e. advanced micro-structured electrode fabrication techniques, and EMG detection and analysis algorithm. Taking advantage of nanofabrication technology, we have developed improved dry electrodes by introducing micro-structures. The microneedle electrodes featuring sharp structures ensure stable adhesion for long-term detection and prevent bleeding and pain. In addition, the mesh patterned electrodes exhibit high flexibility and good breathability for long-time wearing. With the combination of electrodeposition and photolithography, we can minimise the size of EMG wearable electronics with low cost and high throughput. For the signal analysis, a power-efficient filtering algorithm is developed to remove motion artifact and environmental noise. A highly integrated FPGA/RISC-V based processing unit is adopted for wearable design. We will be able to achieve a modularised design to enable the products to meet the needs of different potential users, i.e., professional athletes, office workers and the elderly. A machine learning evolving algorithm will be developed to predict the suitable exercise intensity for potential users to achieve efficient workout progress.

",Professor Yiu Ming Cheung,"The mission of IntelligenceX (called “the company” hereinafter) is to provide innovative lip-password-based technology as an AI solution, featuring high security reliability, and better user experience for identity verification. Compared with the existing face verification system, lip-password technology is more protective against different malicious attacks, such as photo attack and mask attack. In particular, it provides a perfect solution to address the challenge of distinguishing identical twins. Unlike existing biometrics such as fingerprints, iris, and face, which are unchangeable if stolen and copied, lip-password is changeable, meaning it is more secure for user identity verification. 

Our products and services can be applied to various real-life applications, e.g. mobile lock-screen application (App), door-access control, online financial transactions, and API services. Moreover, lip-password can be used as an independent module to strengthen other existing identity verification systems to prevent attacks and strengthen security.

",Dr. Vivian Huang,"Doctech HK Limited is a semiconductor company adopting a newly developed nano-twin copper material especially for the applications of three-dimensional integrated circuit (3DIC) packing. Doctech focuses on the development and commercialisation of nt-Cu as a promising nanomaterial in redistribution layers (RDLs), Cu interconnects and micro-pillar for consumer electronics. Our goal is to innovate scalable and novel nt-Cu for constructing key devices with the features of low-power consumption and transferability and to provide solutions and platform technologies. The nt-Cu material features a promising Cu-Cu bonding technology, which can provide a lower interfacial resistance, making it an ideal technology for the future hybrid Cu-Cu bonding of monolithic three-dimensional (M3D) ICs packing.","Doctech has invented a novel method to fabricate nano-twin copper (nt-Cu) and nano-grain (nc-Cu) copper electroplating materials. In electroplating, controlling the additive formula and content to obtain a suitable grain structure is the key for RDLs/TSV/Interconnect/Pillars technologies, which are ideally suited for high-density requirements. Different layouts are enabled for fan-out wafer level packages to meet next-generation line/space requirements down to 2 µm. The nt-Cu and nc-Cu chemistries are formulated to enhance the reliability of fine-line RDL and improve via-filling performance. The technology requires the Cu to have optimum uniformity, high purity and reliability, superior via-filling and reduced manufacturing costs. A hybrid structure is constructed for future hybrid bonding. The two kinds of copper materials, nt-Cu and nc-Cu, can achieve direct hybrid copper-copper bonding technology at low-temperature, to promote bonding to form a stable and void-free interface and to solve the key issues in M3DIC packing for electromigration (EM) and thermomigration (TM).",香港鉑識科技有限公司,"Room 02, Unit 111-113 & 115, 1/F,

Sramek Insight‘s vision is to bring ICU-grade hemodynamic technologies to the public, and raise awareness on treating cardiovascular issues with a non-drug approach.
","Cardiax Home is a wearable smart cardiovascular analyzer, which delivers continuous real-time hemodynamic data to provide customized wellness and medical advice. Cardiax Home comprises a blood flow sensor, a data router and a graphene-based blood pressure watch. The application of TEBCO technology (impedance) in ICG sensors provides complete information on blood flow conditions and vascular activity. To improve measurement accuracy, repeatability, and sensitivity to micro-pressure, the sensors of the blood pressure watch are covered by graphene nonconductive material as a conductive layer. The data router also serves as a watch charger to reduce the instability of the mobile phone with the wireless sensor and increase the transmission speed. The user’s heart function and hemodynamic information are then uploaded and transmitted to the intelligent medical cloud for in-depth analysis and diagnosis.
The Cardiax Skin is a revolutionary and innovative product to be distributed together with drug prescriptions. Based on the technical principle of Cardiax Home, Cardiax Skin greatly simplifies the operating procedures by leveraging graphene-based electrodes to establish intimate contact with the skin while not causing any discomfort to the user. The proposed graphene-based electronic skin is ultrathin and soft and can perfectly replace the traditional electrode pads for hemodynamic monitoring with high accuracy and good repeatability. With the engagement of two experienced experts in graphene technology and wearable blood pressure devices, Prof. Vellaisamy Roy and Prof. Jun Tao, the feasibility and market application of Cardiax Skin is well recognized and supported by mature technology.

Octane and or Cetane improving, and (4). combustion improving.  These additives were recognized as “conventional” fuel additives, which had been used for decades, and are still being used now a day!

We, on the other hand, began to explore the alternative technology (Nano-Micelle Fuel Additives) in 2007.  Of which, nano-micelles induce “micro-explosions” inside the engine’s combustion chamber, causing the fuel to burn more completely.  Resulting, more fuel efficiency and reduce exhaust emission.

Our Diesel Additive was granted to play a role in the ""Incu-Tech Programme - Green Technology"", for 3 years.  We are so honor to be a part of HKSTP!  And, we look forward to join forces with HKSTP to exploit this GOLD Mine, “Turning Diesel into a Greener Fuel”.","Micro-Explosion Inside the Atomized Diesel Droplet
As the Diesel Additive adds to the diesel fuel, it diffuses immediately into the diesel, forming minute nano-micelles suspending in the diesel.
Inside the Combustion Chamber, the resulting diesel containing nano-micelle exists as very fine mist in the chamber.  Under pressurized condition and at over 200 C, superheating takes place to the diesel mist, thus, Micro-Explosions occur, further fragmenting the already very fine diesel mist into finer fragments.  As a result, the diesel is burned much more effectively.

Benefits:
•	Ensure Complete Combustion inside the Combustion Chamber
•	Lowering Combustion Chamber Temperature, reduce the formation of NOx

Results:
•	Save Diesel Fuel

We understand through our first-hand experience how difficult the app store has become for an app to get the downloads and revenue it deserves.

We were frustrated. But we knew we could find a better way, and we did! 

We first came up with our own formula of doing app store optimization. With the formula, we increased the app downloads by 1478% in less than a month. Later, we found more ways to boost app downloads by applying artificial intelligence and big data analysis on the app store.

With this knowledge, we created Meatti. We aim at helping app developers increase their app downloads with a simple and data-driven platform that works. They can then build better app businesses and focus on what they do best - making great apps!","Meatti helps mobile app developers increase app downloads using artificial intelligence.

It is essentially a structural floor system that provides a 172kg per square meter of carbon emission saving when compared to conventional building system. It is a high performance reinforced concrete floor slab that allows greater column span and minimizes the material usage of concrete and steel reinforcement when compared to conventional structural floor system. It has many benefits that could be translated into cost saving or value-adding depending on the stakeholders involved.

By using the MatrixDeck System as a replacement for the structural slab alone shall generate a cost saving of 10% in superstructure construction. Further cost saving of up to 30% could be realized if a building project adopts the MatrixDeck system at the onset of project inception and design the building holistically with MatrixDeck system as the basis of integral building design and construction.

A successful technology was not built up in a day. Through continuous research, development, review and market feedback, our goal is to improve the world through engineering and technology. As our name APPcider, we will continue develop exciting software application to improve the life.","We believe most of you having the experience of online shopping, will also agree its benefits. Shipping (i.e. goods being shipped from merchant to end-consumer) becomes the key of entire operation process and user experience

Unfortunately, Online Shop Merchant, End-Consumer and Courier Company encountered many problems in current operation workflow:

For example, if online shop merchants want to connect their online shop to DHL or FedEx's automated order system to arrange delivery, it requires a deep technical knowledge. Besides, DHL and FedEx do not provide local and frozen delivery services. For consumers, there is a high demand for goods being delivered at a specific time, and hope that the online shop can provide more and best delivery options. For local logistics companies, although the company size is relatively small, they can often provide flexibility and more considerate service. Unfortunately, they cannot master the technology of connecting with online shops and the way to contact online shop merchants

There is a huge supply and demand of Shipping service - ShipAny is the all-in-one and fully end-to-end automated solution, which utilises Cloud, ERP workflow and online shop integration technology, target to accelerate the development of E-Commerce!",Appcider Limited,"Unit 343, 3/F, Building 19W

(1)  F18-PSMA (prostate-specific membrane antigen) for diagnosis of prostate cancer:
Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is a transmembrane protein expressed in all types of prostatic tissue, but with increased PSMA expression in prostate cancer tissue.  Ga-68 or F-18 labeled PSMA has been developed as an imaging agent for prostate cancer patient. F-18 labeled PSMA would provide a better alternative because of its longer half life (2 hrs) and much higher yield , thus can be produced in large amounts per batch, enabling services to multiple clinics, and benefiting many more patients.

(2)  Ga-68 DOTA compounds used for diagnosis of neuro-endocrine tumors:
Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) are tumors arising from the neuroendocrine cells dispersed through the body derived from the neural crest, and with increased expression of somatostatin receptor on cell membrane. The incidence of these tumors is rising.  Ga-68 labeled somatostatin analogues such as DOTATATE are developed as PET tracers for NETs and have shown excellent results in management of NET such as diagnosis, staging, selection of therapy candidates and monitoring therapy response.

(3)  F-18 FMC (fluoro-methyl-choline) for diagnosis of liver cancer:
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is highly malignant and deadly. The sensitivity of routine 18F-FDG PET for detecting HCC is poor.  Choline is an essential component in synthesis of cell membrane, which is essential in metabolism of HCC.  There is an increased uptake of choline into HCC.  F-18 FMC has been proposed as a better method for the detection of HCC. Dual tracers PET/CT scan using FMC and FDG can improve HCC detection sensitivity to as high as 94%.

(4)  FET for diagnosis of brain cancer:
18F-FET PET has shown value in the diagnosis of brain tumor recurrence after initial surgery or radiotherapy and for directing biopsy or radiosurgery.",Health Gene Limited,,Reserved,,,Health Gene Limited,,Reserved,,

Information Communications Technology,資訊及通訊科技,资讯及通讯科技,,,,Computational Soft Limited,http://www.computationalsoft.com,,,,,,,"Synopsis

Imbued with the recently visionary mission committed by The HKSAR Government to seriously re-embark (or re-invigorate) on the developments of sustainable, blooming, hi-tech and knowledge-based sub-economies in Hong Kong, Computational Soft (CS) was set up as an incubatory SME R&D startup enterprise in The Hong Kong Science Park in October 2017.    
	
Collaborating with local, national and international academic, research, professional and industrial communities including public sectors, CS implements a time-cost efficient-effective technological, cloud-computing based hub to research and develop bona fide innovative, commercially and highly competitive suites of Computational Science and Engineering (CSE) software synonymous with Computerized Modeling and Simulation (CMS) software, playing a historically unprecedented hybrid role of consulting and vendor not only in Hong Kong and China but also the rest of the world.    

Totally unlike the popularly known computer software or programs associated with IT, AI (Artificial Intelligence), Big Data, e-commerce, fintech, social media and apps, CSE or CMS on the other hand intertwiningly spans all “hard” scientific-engineering disciplines.  In a nutshell, whether well-established or embryonic scientific-engineering disciplines or frontiers, they are predicated upon sets of advanced mathematical models (by and large, vast sets of highly nonlinear and fully coupled Partial and Ordinary Differential Equations and Algebraic Equations).   These models and simulations are paramount to not only state-of-the-art scientific research but also, equally important, all large, critical, nuanced, complex or sophisticated engineering investigations, analyses and designs as a must CAD/CAE based desktop engineering tool.

The mission of CS is to locally spearhead an ever unprecedented, knowledge-based yet credible sub-economy in Hong Kong hence Greater China, orbiting around yet advancing the art, science, practice and commerciality of the CSE or CMS fields and their related industries and user communities, by rigorously and robustly, researching, developing, verifying, validating, benchmarking; and, finally, successfully commercializing the first generation of HK-CN branded CSE/CMS suites by 2020.   

The genesis and the ultimate CS visions are as follows.  Foremost, under the auspices of Science Park, HKSAR Government and a few ad hoc academic-research-professional consortia, CS will successfully launch a few suites of innovative, competitive, well-established CSE/CMS products especially in Computational Mechanics – with the intent to bring HKSAR and China to an international arena which presently has been fully monopolized by expatriate vendors for decades.  Ultimately, CS will formidably compete with all the internationally renowned or top-echelon CSE/CMS vendors head to head, toe to toe, with a few dozens of regional offices throughout the globe currently reaping approximately USD6B sales per annum.

CS cordially invites all levels of academic, research, professional, industrial, financial and governmental entities and individuals, especially students and interns, via synergistic collaborations or consortia, to join this both exciting and challenging venture in order to materialize the mission of this uniquely innovative and fruitful R&D project set forth; i.e., creating an ever unprecedented, knowledge-based Computational Science and Engineering (CSE) or Computerized Modeling and Simulation (CMS) software sub-economy in Hong Kong.","R&D Products

Although these kinds of mathematical models, usually stemming from the so-called phenomenological or conservation laws, have been formally and rigorously devised for many centuries (case in point, classical Newtonian Mechanics), still to date, manual solutions by hand calculators are unfortunately intractable.  Hence, the numerical solutions inevitably resort to computers equipped with fast CPUs and enormous memories (RAMs) via another branch of advanced mathematics; i.e., Numerical Methods.  It serves as the backbones of all kinds of CSE or CMS software (high-level computer languages or codes such as Fortran and C) thereby utilizing purely arithmetic operations coined numerical algorithms per se.  In turn, these well researched and developed CS products seamlessly and versatilely  interface so-called pre- and post-processors; i.e., CAD/CAE mesh/grid generators and CAD/CAE visualization/ graphical packages, respectively.        

CS currently debuts its incubatory flagship R&D prototype at Hong Kong Science Park; i.e., Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) software, which is a major subset of CSE/CMS conglomeration.  Pending several trademark and copyright applications from various jurisdictions, the debuting CFD software is being coined Versat©.  In addition, the technological crux of Versat© has been legally protected in China by filing an initial CFD patent with State Intellectual Property of China (SIPO) in March 2015 followed by two previously and successfully preliminary and intermediate examinations now pending the final approval upon the continually public-critical examination. 

Versat©, genuinely and originally innovated, can be argubly deemed the most technologically superior CFD software out in the existing public and commercial CFD markets, in the context that it provides an unique set of unmatchable production differentiations.  Valued customers and users of  Versat©, whether novice or seasoned, can freely pick and choose whatever past, pres",Computational Soft Limited,,,,,Computational Soft Limited,,,,

When we look around, one does not know which clock can be trusted.  They are showing different times.  So we make a clock you can trust – RDS clock.  All are accurate to second, and thus look the same!

Although China has set up a RCC transmitter in Henan Province, we cannot benefit from it as it is 1,200 km away!  The Japanese RCC tower is even more far away!

Seeing this, we decided to make use of the reliable time data in the FM RDS broadcasting to synchronize the clock with the atomic clock at Hong Kong Observatory.  

It works, and is welcome by hospitals and schools so far after we launched shortly.

To go on serving the users with accurate time keeping devices, we will develop large wall clock and small watches as well.  All these will be the same – accurate, which is something you can trust!","ACCUE RDS Clock, with patented technology, selects and locks on local radio channels that transmit correct time signal.  It shows exactly accurate time for Hong Kong.  

As long as ACCUE RDS Clock is placed within the covered area of the FM stations, which is almost everywhere in HK, it can accordingly display the exactly accurate time easily.  

Compared with RCC clocks, which signal comes from either Henan Province or Japan, is too weak to receive in Hong Kong.
",確時股份有限公司,,,"ACCUE 意思是準確，我們致力提供準確的計時設備。

環顧四周，時鐘之間互有偏差，哪一個可以信賴呢？所以，我們決定開發一個能令你信賴的 RDS 時鐘。

雖然國內在河南省設有 RCC 發射站，但距香港1200 公里，日本的則更遠，更收不到時間訊號。

有見及此，我們決定用香港可靠的 FM RDS 廣播，接收其來自天文台原子鐘之時間訊號，然後與之同步，從而令所有時鐘顯示相同時間！

由推出至今短短時間內，即廣受醫院、學校等歡迎。

往後我們仍會繼續開發準確的計時設備，如大型壁鐘及手錶等等，它們的共同特點是：準確！","ACCUE RDS 電波鐘是香港註冊專利的設計技術，篩選並鎖定發射準確時間訊號的電台，為本地提供一秒不差的計時器。

只要在能夠接收到 FM 頻道的地方，ACCUE RDS 電波鐘便能接收到RDS 電台的時間信息，從而為用戶顯示準確時間。

與接收遙遠的日本或中國 RCC 訊號的電波鐘相比，我們的 RDS 電波鐘容易接收太多了，甚至於在客廳或厨房，不用靠窗邊都可收到。

Results from academic research will be put to serve needs in authentication and archeological dating.","Thermoluminescence (TL) is the phenomenon of the emission of light from solids when it is heated.  This light is the result of the release of energy which has been stored in the form of trapped electrons, in the substance through the absorption of nuclear radiation to which the substance has been exposed.  Consequently the amount of TL observed is proportional to the overall dose of radiation which has been received.  In most ceramics there are mineral constituents (e.g., quartz) which have the property of TL.  Heating the ceramic to around 500C or more removes the geologically accumulated TL completely.  Thus the firing of raw clay into ceramic sets the “TL clock” to zero time.

",Dr. Yannie Chan,"inCompass IP International incorporating inCompass IP (Europe), inCompass IP (Hong Kong) and Carmichael & Co. (Singapore) comprises a team of attorneys based in our London, Singapore and Hong Kong offices qualified to act directly before the US, UK, European, Singaporean, Hong Kong, Chinese*, New Zealand and Australian Patent Offices. Using our secure, web-based case management system, our team works as a virtual single world-wide team.

Unlike other local firms, who utilize foreign agencies, we provide international IP services directly to local clients - our attorneys are the ones actually handling your matter, not a foreign agent instructed by the local firm.  For clients with families of cases, such as some of our large corporate clients, our coverage provides the strategic advantage of ensuring uniformity of prosecution of multi-jurisdictional IP filings as well as reduced prosecution costs.

We are an award-winning firm with attorneys who have been recognised as world-leading practitioners in respected industry journals, and our services have been engaged in major IP court cases.","We provide the full range of IP law services, covering all IP rights including patents, designs, and trade marks.  These include: original patent drafting; legal opinions for infringement, validity, and freedom-to-operate; application, prosecution, and grant for all registrable IP rights; enforcement of rights; litigation support; commercialisation services.  Our legal opinion services in support of litigation are award-winning.

We also manage renewals for IP portfolios.  Our diverse team of attorneys and professionals enables us to provide a renewal payment service which we believe is more competitive than many of the major annuity service providers.

Specific examples of services include: in Europe, we persuade the EPO to grant applications without the need for unnecessary summonses to oral hearings; in China, we use our expertise and experience to report Examiner's objections in clear English with pertinent guidance on issues to be addressed without the need for unnecessary translation or comment; in Singapore, we guide our clients to the most effective examination procedure option.",因可保有限公司,"Unit 205, 2/F, Building 19W,

",Mr. Ingbert Miesczalok (left),"MetaSystems is an employee-owned German company specializing in automated scanning and image analysis for cytogenetics, cancer genetics and other applications. Founded in 1986 as spin-off from the Institute of Applied Physics at the University of Heidelberg, the company started with the development of an automatic metaphase finding system. MetaSystems is based on over 20 years of experience in chromosome analysis, automated microscopy, and hard- and software technology. This background ensures MetaSystems being at the forefront of technology. A number of innovative features have been introduced by MetaSystems for the first time before they were also adopted by our competitors (e.g. CGH analysis with real-color karyotyping and profile averaging). In early 1997, MetaSystems presented the first commercial software for filter-based 24 color FISH (mFISH) analysis. In March 1998, the unique high resolution multi color banding (mBAND) technique was introduced in cooperation with the Institute of Human Genetics in Jena, Germany. 

The first Metafer metaphase finding system was sold and installed in 1987. Since the introduction of the karyotyping system Ikaros in 1991, a product addressing a wider market, MetaSystems grew dynamically and established its position as a leading supplier of cytogenetic imaging solutions. Today, more than 2,500 MetaSystems products are installed in more than 600 laboratories all over the world. 

In 2005, MetaSystems opened a branch office in Hong Kong named MetaSystems Asia Co. Ltd. MetaSystems Asia Ltd. is a wholly owned subsidiary of MetaSystems GmbH in Germany.

**Introduction:**
Coworkshop Solutions Limited specializes in providing comprehensive solutions for Data Loss Prevention (DLP). They offer user-friendly interfaces and support over 500 applications, ensuring that businesses can protect their sensitive data with ease. Their products are designed to address the challenges of data leakage, especially in the modern work environment where remote work and online meetings are prevalent.

**Key Technologies and Products:**

1. **Curtain e-locker**: This is a comprehensive Data Loss Prevention system designed to safeguard sensitive information during everyday operations. The system ensures that users can work on sensitive files without the risk of unauthorized data leakage.

2. **Curtain MonGuard**: This tool is designed to display a screen-watermark on users' computers. Given the increasing trend of remote work and online meetings, there's a risk of users capturing sensitive information displayed on screens using mobile phones or other devices. While it's challenging to prevent such actions, Curtain MonGuard aims to deter unauthorized screen captures by displaying watermarks that can show user-specific information, such as computer name, username, and IP address. This not only acts as a deterrent but also helps trace the source of potential data leaks.

**Challenges Addressed:**
- **Remote Work**: Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, there's been a surge in remote work. This means companies have to allow users to download data to their personal devices or connect to the company's network through VPN, increasing the risk of data leaks.
  
- **Online Meetings**: Sharing sensitive information, such as contracts or training materials, during online meetings poses a security challenge. Curtain MonGuard's watermarking feature ensures that even if participants capture the screen, the source of potential data leaks can be traced.

",Mr. Deak Kim,"AgaMatrix is a technology company that has successfully commercialized over 10 FDA-cleared medical diagnostics products in the glucose/ diabetes monitoring space.  Founded in 2001 by scientists from MIT and Cambridge, AgaMatrix has grown to 130 employees worldwide, with offices in the US, UK, South Korea and China, and a stellar management team and investors that include founders/ executives from MediSense and Inverness Medical (two leaders in the Blood Glucose industry).  Together with manufacturing partners in South Korea and newly acquired factories in China, there are more 500 people supporting the production of AgaMatrix products.

AgaMatrix develops and manufactures a line of diabetes products designed to improve the quality of diabetes care.  The company’s products feature WaveSense, a new technology that personalizes each test to provide world class accuracy.  WaveSense Dynamic Electrochemistry is a novel DSP-based (Digital Signal Processing) method of real-time feedback algorithms to control the accuracy of electrochemical sensors.

To date, AgaMatrix attracted many high-profile commercial partners.  Sanofi-Aventis, one of the largest pharmaceutical companies in the world, and the largest manufacturer of insulin, has selected AgaMatrix as its Glucose Meter partner and is commercializing the world’s first glucose meter connected to the IPhone.  In the US, AgaMatrix has partnered with the largest mail-order MediCare provider, Medco, to supply private-labeled glucose meters (under its ‘Liberty’ brand).  Additionally, AgaMatrix has partnered with Perrigo, the US’s largest store-brand supplier/ manufacturer of over-the-counter medical products.  AgaMatrix’s reputation for high quality and innovation has allowed it to grow into a multi-national company with top tier partners.","The current primary focus of commercialization of AgaMatrix is in blood glucose monitoring.  AgaMatrix does have its own brand (called WaveSense); however, the majority of products are sold via private-label partnerships.  The Blood Glucose Monitoring system include a meter, a vial of single-use test strips and a lancing device and lancets (for extracting blood).  In addition, AgaMatrix also makes desktop-PC based software for connecting to and downloading meter readings (called Zero-Click).  AgaMatrix’s WaveSense-branded glucose meter products include meters called KeyNote, Presto and Jazz.  The ‘pro’ series are meters that include a mechanical test strip ejection system (KeyNote Pro, Presto Pro).

The most notable recent product innovation that AgaMatrix has developed is the world’s first iPhone-connected glucose meter, sold internationally by Sanofi-Aventis under the name iBGStar (www.ibgstar.com).  In addition, Sanofi-Aventis is also distributing another AgaMatrix glucose meter system called the ‘BGStar’.

AgaMatrix was also the world’s first glucose meter company to develop an iPhone app for diabetics called the ‘WaveSense Diabetes Manager’.  It was consistently been rated the best app of its kind in the iTunes store.

Through its relationship with Perrigo, AgaMatrix is distributing its glucose meter system to major US retailers like Target and Krogers.  Through its international partners, AgaMatrix glucose monitoring systems are also being sold in Europe by MedTrust (under the name ‘Wellion Linus’) and in China by Grace Medical (under the name ‘Grace Pro’).",安格生物科技有限公司,"Unit 209, 2/F, Lakeside One,

We enable them to use occupational psychology and data analytics for recruitment and to high performing workforces with ease. TalenX originated from our observation that companies are still using resumes and interviews as predictors of job success. What we find in resumes is that their good at telling you some things, such as the candidate's experience or their hard skills. But they don't do a good job explaining to you about the intangible side of things such as are they going to be a good leader? Do they like to work as a team or work by themselves? Fortune 500 companies already know the benefits of understanding the candidates beyond what is presented in a resume, so they incorporate these psychological tools as part of their hiring process. However, small companies find it difficult to get their hands on such tools, due to the expensive consulting services, overpriced test and complex reports. With Talen, you the small-medium size business will be able to understand the human side of your candidates before even meeting them for the first time.","The TalenX Talent Acquisitions platform is a cloud-based web-app designed to help the hiring managers administer, collect and analyze candidate’s psychometrics results efficiently. At the core of the platform lies our personality assessment, that measures 43 workplace behaviours and incorporates an innovative “quasi-ipsative” test-taking format designed to improve scoring consistency and reduce faking in candidates.  Once a candidate completes the test, the hiring manager will instantly know the candidate’s level of fit to the job and receive in-depth insights into candidates’ natural behavioural styles. The system will also automatically generate a job fit report, which includes custom interview questions for the hiring manager to use in the interview to probe the candidate deeper.

",Mr. Alexander Wesley,"Arovia gives you the freedom to do more in more places by, ultimately, making a full-size TV or computer monitor that fits in your pocket.

Problem: Customers need large (20+ -inch diagonal) screens as evidenced by large computer monitors and large TVs dominating the office and home.However, mobility is paramount and there is no large and portable display device.

Solution: The Spontaneous Pop-Up Display (SPUD) is a 24-inch HD, battery-powered, display system that collapses for portability and expands in seconds. Use-cases include productivity, tradeshows, video, gaming, and presentations. When fully collapsed, it is the size of a book and weighs less than 1.5 kilograms. SPUD connects to devices via HDMI or wireless adapter. Arovia plans a pocketable version as well as versions with larger screen sizes, touch screens, operating systems, and smartphone apps for wireless connectivity.","Arovia developed and patented (2 utility/1 design patent granted) the material science behind the first projection screen that mitigates wrinkles, the first mechanics for a one-step pop-up collapsible display, and the shortest projection optics currently on the market for a pocket size projector, so SPUD can fit on a desk.

nCloud: Software-defined Distributed Storage on ""Multiple Clouds""

We explore cloud diversity to achieve fault-tolerant storage by striping data redundancy across multiple cloud storage services, so as to provide data availability and durability guarantees in the face of cloud outages. The nCloud, a proof-of-concept prototype of a network-coding-based cloud storage system that aims at providing fault tolerance and reducing data repair cost when storing files using multi-cloud storage. nCloud uses a proxy-based design that interconnects multiple cloud storage providers and exports a file system interface that enables applications to seamlessly manage cloud storage through standard file system operations. nCloud builds on a network coding scheme called the Maximum Distance Separable (MDS) codes, which maintains the same storage overhead as traditional erasure coding under the same data redundancy level, while minimizing the amount of repair traffic (with up to 50% of reduction) and hence the monetary cost due to data transfers.","We have implemented nCloud by storing and “striping” data diversely to achieve fault-tolerant storage across multiple cloud storage services by a proxy-based design. The benefits are:

a.	Security: To any cloud service, nCloud will only store a portion but not the whole file. Any data is encoded and encrypted.
b.	Disaster Recovery (DR): If any single node cloud service outage happens, nCloud can still be running.
c.	Auto Recovery: When the node is back to service, nCloud will repair the node by saving 66.7% traffic than traditional approach.
d.	Storage Saving: For 1:1 data replication, nCloud saves upto 80% disk space compared to traditional DR approaches.

Current technologies in ketone sensing are either invasive or offer ketone sensing with low sensitivity in the concentration range of 1mg ketone bodies per liter air (ppm) and low specificity. Our semiconductor ketone gas sensor provides ketone sensing capability in the range of part per billion range which is over 1000X more sensitive. Imagine a person starts to run on a treadmill hoping to lose fat, while human breath contains 200ppb of ketone bodies at rest when a person starts to burn more fat the breath ketone concentration would increase. Only our sensor could indicate improving fat burning rate. A person seeing an instant positive results is a motivated person.","Our sensor fabrication process utilizes a proprietary technique called flame brush pyrolysis (FBP). The metal precursor is sprayed upon gold interdigitated electrodes via FBP to form a sensor. FBP can produce nanoparticles as small as 15nm. When a population of nanoparticles are sprayed upon a substrate, they form a porous structure which has a high surface area. It allows gas to enter and leave easily making the sensor highly sensitive and responsive. Then the sensor is required to be packaged in a proprietary sensor suspension packaging in order to be used with other devices as a module.

The sensing mechanism utilizes the characteristic of an n-type semiconductor i.e. tungsten oxide to form a layer of adsorbed oxygen ion to react with target gas. When tungsten oxide encounter ketone gas a redox reaction would happen to give an electrical signal.",王態科技有限公司,"Unit 718, 7/F, Building 19W,

",Professor Wai Ho Raymond Yeung,"n-hop technologies has developed BATS, a revolutionary communication technology based on the fundamental research on network coding at The Chinese University of Hong Kong. The two main founders of our company, Prof. Raymond Yeung and Prof. Shenghao Yang, are the inventors of this technology. 

In loT, most devices cannot be directly connected to the wireline network, but rather need to go through many other wireless loT devices. Thus wireless multi-hop networks will be in great demand. BATS can dramatically improve the performance of such networks. The gain brought about by BATS, which increases with the number of hops, is unbounded. With BATS, the transmission throughput can sustain after tens or even hundreds of hops. 

BATS has already been proven successful in the Hong Kong Government's pilot smart lamppost system. A very wide range of other applications can benefit from BATS, including 5G, loT, V2X, satellite communication, and underwater acoustic communication.","It is a well-known problem that in a wireless multi-hop network, the transmission throughput drops drastically when the number of hops exceeds 5 or 6, due to the accumulation of packet loss. BATS is a disruptive communication technology that can break this ""multi-hop curse"". With BATS, the transmission throughput can sustain after tens or even hundreds of hops. 

BATS can dramatically increase the throughput of a lossy multi-hop network over any physical layer, be it short-range wireless (e.g., Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, ZigBee), medium-range wireless (e.g., LTE), long-range wireless (e.g., VSAT for satellite communication), or even underwater communication (e.g., acoustic, optical). A very wide range of applications will benefit from BATS. In particular, BATS has been successfully deployed in the Hong Kong Government's pilot smart lamppost project, in which BATS provides the smart lampposts with wireless Internet connection without the need to lay optical fibre to every lamppost.",安眺科技有限公司,"Unit 1031 & 1043, 10/F., Building 19W,

",Professor Wai Ho Raymond Yeung,"建基於香港中文大學網絡編碼的基礎研究，安眺科技開發了一種名為BATS的革命性通信技術。我們公司的兩位主要創始人楊偉豪教授和楊升浩教授正是這項技術的發明者。

在物聯網中大多數的設備需要通過其他無線物聯網設備連接到有線網絡，因此無線多跳網絡將有極大的需求。BATS技術可以大大提高此類網絡的性能，其所帶來的增益隨著跳數增加而没有上限。使用BATS，傳輸速率可以經過數十甚至數百跳之後仍得以維持。

BATS已成功部署在香港政府的智慧燈柱先導系統。BATS還有很廣泛的應用，包括5G，loT，V2X，衛星通信和水底聲學通信等。", ,安眺科技有限公司,"Unit 1031 & 1043, 10/F., Building 19W,

Traditional photovoltaics are opaque, stiff, ugly, and fragile, unable to meet the needs of emerging markets. eFlexPV aims to commercialize the next-generation semitransparent, color-tunable and eco-friendly. Our market-oriented R&D is based on the technology originated from the scientific breakthrough of Professor He YAN (Henry) and his team at HKUST. In 2015, Prof. Yan’s research group demonstrated a world-record OPV efficiency of 11.5%, the first major scientific research achievement in the Greater China region that has been recorded in the internationally recognized NREL best-efficiency chart in the past 40 years. In 2019, eFlexPV broke the work record of tandem OPV efficiency and realized a certified 16.4% efficient single-junction OPV device. eFlexPV works on developing and commercializing highly efficient and stable third-generation OPV materials, devices and module, as well as exploring prototypes of OPV products for different markets. On the basis of material research and process exploration, eFlexPV will find OPV applications in building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPVs), vehicle-integrated photovoltaics (VIPVs), indoor PV applications such as cable-free sensors for Internet of Things (IoT), power-generating tents and other portable PV fields. While developing products and markets, eFlexPV will continue to improve its technology and maintain our leading position in scientific research.","1. Novel OPV materials with power conversion efficiencies >15%
2. Organic photovoltaic devices and modules for indoor applications, e.g. smoke detectors, clocks, smart locks, smart switches, and variable sensors (need to order and customize)
3. Organic photovoltaic panels for outdoor applications (need to order and customize)
Technology:
Unlike traditional crystalline silicon-based solar cells, organic photovoltaics (OPVs) are semitransparent, flexible, color-tunable and eco-friendly. These beneficial features endow OPV with various niche markets such as indoor PV markets (high indoor efficiency), vehicle-integrated PV markets (color-tunable, flexible), building-integrated PV markets (semitransparent, light-weight) and portable PV markets (light-weight, flexible).
The last few years have witnessed a significant progress for OPVs. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) increased dramatically to above 16%.
The current research focus of OPV is to replace fullerenes with new non-fullerene materials. Non-fullerene-based third-generation OPVs will have higher PCE, longer life, more colors, higher transparency (adjustable), and therefore will have a broader market where traditional photovoltaic that cannot be applied. Meanwhile, OPVs can be produced from eco-friendly processes using Roll-to-Roll printing method, which renders dramatic advantage in cost-reduction over other PV technologies when the shipment volume is large.",eFlexPV Limited,,Dr. Guangye Zhang,eFlexPV于2018年在香港創立。公司旨在研發和市場化的有機光伏技術具有半透明、色彩多樣、柔性、室內效率高等特色，可以應用在眾多傳統光伏無法應用的領域。公司技術源於香港科大顏河教授的科研突破，2015年實現的11.5%的有機光伏光電轉化效率是大中華區首次被錄入NREL紀錄表的重大成果。2019年，eFlexPV打破疊層有機光伏效率世界紀錄，並實現國際認證16.4%的轉化效率。 公司專注第三代有機光伏材料及器件的研發，開發針對不同市場的產品原型，探索並推廣有機光伏在室內物聯網供電、半透明發電玻璃幕牆、車載光伏等領域的應用。,"1.	高效率有機光伏材料（轉化效率>15%）

Oysters are a wonderful food source – not only do they provide high nutritional value to humans, but they also clean up the ocean. Oyster shells are predominantly made up of calcium carbonate. Oysters also consume marine algae, which consumes the atmospheric carbon dioxide dissolved in seawater. These dual-engines can significantly lower greenhouse gases when deployed at a large scale.

After detecting all users have left the washroom, the robot will self-navigate to washroom compartments, extend the waterproof shell, and start cleaning with highly-pressurized spray. ZeeqClean innovatively adopts contactless pressurized spraying to avoid secondary pollution from conventional scrubbing. The robot can lift the toilet lid for cleaning, automatically dry the toilet bowls or urinals after cleaning and begin ultraviolet sterilization.
